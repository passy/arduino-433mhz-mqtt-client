# arduino-433mhz-mqtt-client

I use this setup to accept previously captured "tri-states"
over MQTT (from Adafruit) and control a bunch of cheap 433 Mhz
remote control switches (like the [Etekcity Zaps](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programmable-Electrical-Household-Appliances-Operating/dp/B01FX9U0WA)).

## Usage

Register an Adafruit account, set up a feed (called "zap" in my setup),
and fill in the `setup.h`. Flash onto a compatible WiFi-capable ES8266 Arduino.
Enjoy.
